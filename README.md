# Project 3: Spots

### Overview

This Project is called "Spots". In this project, I've created the layout of a mock social media website where people can create profiles, share pictures, and like one another's photos. This website is especially made for both desktop and mobile screen sizes.

**Project Features**

- Semantic HTML5
- CSS
- BEM Methodology
- Flexbox
- Grid
- Responsive Design
- Javascript
- APIs

  Using a combination of Grid and Flexbox, I was able to easily set up the website in a way that uses responsive design, ensuring that the website renders well on all screen sizes and resolutions. Using Javascript and APIs, the website is now fully functional! You can add or remove your own pictures and text, and your edits will persist even after you leave the webpage.
